Sophisticated https://www.reaper.fm/[REAPER] MIDI/MCU/OSC-learn VST instrument plug-in for controlling REAPER with feedback.

== Installation

The easiest and preferred way of installing ReaLearn is via https://reapack.com/[ReaPack], a
sort of "app store" for REAPER. It allows you to keep your installation of ReaLearn up-to-date very easily.

=== Install for the first time

If you previously installed ReaLearn manually, please uninstall it first!

. Install https://reapack.com/[ReaPack] if not done so already
. Extensions → ReaPack → Import repositories…
. Copy and paste the following repository URL:
+
 https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-packages/raw/master/index.xml
+
. Extensions → ReaPack → Browse packages…
. Search for `realearn`
. Right mouse click on the ReaLearn package → Install…
. OK or Apply
. Restart REAPER

**Linux users only:**

- You also need `libxdo` installed, otherwise ReaLearn won't scan.
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y libxdo-dev`

=== Update to the latest stable version

ReaLearn development moves fast. In order to take advantage of new features, improvements and fixes, you should check for updates from time to time.

. Extensions → ReaPack → Synchronize packages
** It will tell you if a new version has been installed.
. Restart REAPER

=== Test new features and improvements

If you want to get access to cutting-edge but untested versions of ReaLearn, you have two options:

Install a specific pre-release:

. Right mouse click on the ReaLearn package → Versions
. Select any version ending on `-pre.*` or `-rc.*`
. OK or Apply
. Restart REAPER

Enable pre-releases globally:

. Extensions → ReaPack → Manage repositories → Options… → Enable pre-releases globally (bleeding edge)
. After that, whenever you synchronize packages, you will get the latest stuff.

=== Install manually

If you are more the download type of person, you can find the latest `dll`, `dylib` and `so` files here at
GitHub on the https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/releases[releases page] for manual installation.
You also must install ReaLearn manually if you plan to use ReaLearn in both REAPER for Windows 32-bit
and REAPER for Windows 64-bit because then it's important to use two separate VST plug-in directories.

*Please note that it's impossible to run ReaLearn as a bridged plug-in.* If you have
"Preferences → Plug-ins → Compatibility → VST bridging/firewalling" set to "In separate plug-in process" or
"In dedicated process per plug-in", you will need to add an exception for ReaLearn by setting "Run as" to
"Native only"!

== Usage

=== Quick start

ReaLearn is fired up just like any other VST instrument in REAPER: By adding it to an FX chain.

=== Videos

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ySGt9Ejc-M&list=PL0bFMT0iEtAgKY2BUSyjEO1I4s20lZa5G&index=1[The ReaLearn Tutorials] is a fairly new ongoing series of short video tutorials available.

There's also a long https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPyqYaIkYA[introduction video] from 2021. Watch 2 minutes to get a first
impression and stay tuned if you are interested in the details.

=== User guide

ReaLearn features a large and complete user guide.

- https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/blob/master/doc/realearn-user-guide.adoc[Read it right here on GitHub] (preferred, best readability)
- https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/releases/latest/download/realearn-user-guide.pdf[Download user guide as PDF file]

TIP: The main focus of ReaLearn's user guide is being comprehensive, so it's more like a reference manual and can get quite detailed and technical. If you prefer a simple hands-on approach, the <<videos,tutorial videos>> are a better choice.


=== Supported controllers

ReaLearn is designed to be generic and support any controller. That's why you won't find a definitive list of supported controllers! But there's a link:doc/controllers.adoc[list of tested controllers].

TIP: Keep in mind: Even if your controller is not on the list, you probably can make it work with ReaLearn!
