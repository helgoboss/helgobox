ðŸ‘‹ Hi! We appreciate your suggestions. 

Please submit your idea in the "Discussions" section!

1. Press the "Discussions" button on the top.
2. Choose the category "Ideas".
3. Check if your idea is already in the list (maybe another user had the same or a similar idea). If yes, please don't submit a new idea, just vote for the existing one by pressing the â†‘ button left to it. You can also comment on it.
3. If your idea is really new, press the button "New discussion".

If you submit your new idea right here in the "Issues" section, no problem. Just be aware that we will move it to the "Discussions" section later!

Thank you!
