--- realearn_version: 2.16.0-pre.8
--- author: helgoboss
--- description: |
---     This controller preset exposes the push encoders of the Midi Fighter Twister with the "grid" scheme, which means
---     it uses virtual element IDs such as "col1/row1/pad". This makes it compatible with main presets that are
---     built for generic grid controllers.
--- setup_instructions: |
---     The Midi Fighter Twister is a very customizable controller. Please follow the instructions at
---     https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/blob/master/doc/controllers.adoc#dj-techtools-midi-fighter-twister
---     to make it ready for ReaLearn.
