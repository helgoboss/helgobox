=== Arturia MiniLab 3

This keyboard works, with the following features:
* All Encoders and Faders work
* All Pads work (incl. the 8 on Bank B)
* Transport control works
* Feedback works for Pads (white) and transport control (in respective color)
** For this, there is a mapping for the shift button to ReaLearn: Send feedback to all instances

[discrete]
==== Information / Limitations

* Encoders are absolute on the MiniLab 3 and currently cannot be changed via 
Arturia's https://www.arturia.com/support/downloads&manuals[MIDI Control Center] as for the MiniLab MkII.
* With the current mapping, encoders display their current value that the MiniLab 3 "thinks", but this doesn't update on MIDI feedback.
** Currently working on enabling feedback to the display, which should remove this "limitation".
