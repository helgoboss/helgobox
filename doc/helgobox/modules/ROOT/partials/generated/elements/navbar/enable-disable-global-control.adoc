Enables or disables the usage of global controllers for this Helgobox instance.

If enabled, all connected controllers that you have equipped will load their corresponding main preset. You can configure controllers using the settings button in the window title bar.

If disabled, global controllers will be ignored in this instance. You still have the freedom to create a custom control experience using ReaLearn.
