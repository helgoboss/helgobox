= REAPER actions

== General actions

Helgobox provides a few global REAPER actions.

You can find those actions directly in the menu menu:Extensions[Helgobox].
Alternatively, search for "helgobox" in REAPER's action list (menu:Actions[Show action list...]).

[TIP]
====
On Linux, you currently need to add at least one Helgobox FX instance to make the actions available.

This is likely going to change in the future.
For the time being, it can be useful to put a Helgobox instance on REAPER's monitoring FX chain in order to have access to those actions at all times.
