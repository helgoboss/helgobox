= User interface

Each Helgobox instance can display its own xref:app.adoc[] window, embedded into REAPER:

. Open the xref:plug-in.adoc[]
. Press menu:Menu[Show App]

.App window
image::generated/screenshots/main/home-screen.png[]

At the moment, the app primarily provides the user interface for xref:playtime::introduction.adoc[Playtime], but it will contain more stuff in the future.
