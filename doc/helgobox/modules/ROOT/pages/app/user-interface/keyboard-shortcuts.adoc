= Keyboard shortcuts

Within the app, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts.

|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|[[esc,Esc]] kbd:[Esc]
|Hides the app window.

Hiding the window doesn't completely unload the app, it really just hides the window.

|kbd:[F]
|Toggles full-screen mode.

|kbd:[F1]
|Opens online help for the element that is currently under the mouse cursor.

|kbd:[Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+H]
|Executes the REAPER action xref:helgobox::reaper-actions.adoc#toggle-app-focus[].

|===

Depending on the currently selected page, more keyboard shortcuts are available:

[TIP]
====
**Normal REAPER's keyboard shortcuts are generally disabled when the app is focused!**

This prevents conflicts and ensures flexibility for adding more app shortcuts in the future.

If you want to use a certain REAPER shortcut while the app is focused, you must make it global:

. Open menu:Actions[Show action list...]
. Press btn:[Find shortcut...]
. Press the shortcut key
+
The action list should jump to the action mapped to that key.
. Double-click the desired shortcut in the "Shortcuts for selected action" list
. Change the property "Scope" to **Global**
. Press btn:[OK]
