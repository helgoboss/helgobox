The version number displayed here is the version of the xref:app.adoc[], not the one of the controlled xref:plug-in.adoc[]! _App_ and _plug-in_ are often updated together, but that's not always the case. They can evolve independently.

In the future, the app will be available as a standalone app, then this distinction will make more sense.
