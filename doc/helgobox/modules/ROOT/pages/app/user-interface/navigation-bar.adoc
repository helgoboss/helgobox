= Navigation bar

The bar on the left is the _Navigation bar_.

Its main purpose is to switch between different user interface pages.
You can show or hide it using the xref:app/user-interface/title-bar.adoc#title-bar-toggle-nav-bar[image:generated/screenshots/elements/title-bar/toggle-nav-bar.png[Toggle navigation bar] button] in the xref:app/user-interface/title-bar.adoc[].

If enabled, all connected controllers that you have equipped will load their corresponding main preset.
You can configure controllers using the settings button in the window title bar.

If disabled, global controllers will be ignored in this instance.
You still have the freedom to create a custom control experience using ReaLearn.
