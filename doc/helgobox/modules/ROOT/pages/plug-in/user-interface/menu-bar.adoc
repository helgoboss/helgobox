[[close-app]] Close App::
Closes the xref:helgobox::app.adoc[] associated with this xref:helgobox::key-concepts.adoc#instance[].

[[server]] Server::
Helgobox features a built-in server which allows the xref:app.adoc[] (and the old ReaLearn Companion App) to connect to Helgobox.
The server runs globally, not per instance!

[[enable-and-start-server]] Enable and start!::: This starts the server and makes sure it will automatically be started next time you use Helgobox.

Disable and stop!::: This stops the server and makes sure it will not be started next time you use Helgobox.

Add firewall rule::: Attempts to add a firewall rule for making the server accessible from other devices or displays instructions on how to do it.

[[export-to-clipboard]]
