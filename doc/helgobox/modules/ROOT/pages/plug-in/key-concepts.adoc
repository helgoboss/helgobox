= Key concepts

[[instance]]
== Instance

Helgobox is an instrument plug-in.
That means you can add multiple instances of it, just as you would add multiple instances of a synth or effect.
For example, you could place one instance on the monitoring FX chain and two instances somewhere in your project.

[[instance-id]]
== Instance ID

A randomly assigned ID that uniquely identifies a particular <<instance>>.
Will most likely change after a restart of REAPER!
