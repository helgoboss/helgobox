= Configuration files

Helgobox creates and/or reads a few files in REAPER's resource directory.

For product-specific configuration files, please refer to:

* xref:realearn::configuration-files.adoc[ReaLearn configuration files]
* xref:playtime::configuration-files.adoc[Playtime configuration files]

Helgobox itself maintains the following files:

`Data/helgoboss`:: Directory which contains data such as presets or resources that need to be distributed via ReaPack

`Data/helgoboss/archives`:: Directory which contains archives e.g. the compressed app, distributed via ReaPack

`Data/helgoboss/doc`:: Contains offline documentation as PDFs

`Helgoboss`:: Directory which contains user-specific or device-specific data, not touched via ReaPack

`licensing.json`:: Contains license keys

`Helgoboss/App`:: Contains the uncompressed App, if installed

`Helgoboss/Pot/previews`:: Directory which contains previews recorded by xref:products.adoc#pot-browser[Pot Browser]

`Helgoboss/Server/certificates`:: Contains a list of certificates and corresponding private keys in order to allow encrypted communication with ReaLearn Companion and App.

`Helgoboss/ReaLearn/realearn.ini`:: Very basic global configuration.
The reference to ReaLearn is there just for historical reasons.
Most properties in here affect Helgobox as a whole.
