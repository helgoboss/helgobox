+
 https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-packages/raw/master/index.xml
+

[[i-want-to-install-reapack]]
=== I don't have ReaPack but want to use it to install Helgobox

. Install ReaPack, following the link:https://reapack.com/user-guide[installation section of its user guide]
. Restart REAPER
. Follow the instructions in <<i-have-reapack>>

[[install-without-reapack]]
=== I want to install Helgobox manually, without ReaPack

If you are more the download type of person, you can find the latest `dll`, `dylib` and `so` files here at GitHub on the https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox/releases[releases page] for manual installation.

You also must install Helgobox manually if you plan to use it in both REAPER for Windows 32-bit and REAPER for Windows 64-bit because then it's important to use two separate VST plug-in directories.

== Validating the installation

You know that Helgobox is installed successfully if you see the menu menu:Extensions[Helgobox].

In addition, you should see a plug-in entry {plugin-name} after right-clicking the empty area of REAPER's track panel and choosing menu:Insert virtual instrument on new track...[].

NOTE: On Helgobox for Linux, the extension menu entry doesn't exist yet.
But the plug-in should be there.

== Troubleshooting

=== Helgobox plug-in doesn't appear in the list of plug-ins

If the plug-in {plugin-name} doesn't appear in the list of plug-ins, please proceed as follows:

. If you are on Linux, make sure to follow the <<linux, installation instructions for Linux>>!

. Make sure that Helgobox runs as native plug-in!
** By default, each plug-in runs as native plug-in.
If not, you probably changed the configuration at some point.
** You can fix that by right-clicking {plugin-name} in the plug-in list and select menu:Run as[Native only (prevent bridging)].
** It's technically impossible to run Helgobox as a bridged plug-in!

TIP: If none of these suggestions help, please link:https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox/issues/new/choose[please report a bug]!

Helgobox development moves fast!
