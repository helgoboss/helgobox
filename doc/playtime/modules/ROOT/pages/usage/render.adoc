= Render

At the end, you probably want to render/mix-down/export the arrangement xref:usage/arrangement.adoc[created in the previous step] to an audio file.


All you need to do is to use REAPER's built-in render functionality as usual:

. Open menu:File[Render...]
. Change options if desired
. Press the btn:[Render] button

That's it! Playtime doesn't change anything about the rendering process. In fact, it's not involved anymore at this point.
