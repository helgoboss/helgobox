= REAPER actions

Playtime provides the following REAPER actions in addition to the xref:helgobox::reaper-actions.adoc[general actions].

[[show-hide-playtime]] Helgobox/Playtime: Show/hide Playtime::
If there's no Helgobox instance with a Playtime matrix in the current project, this action adds one and shows the matrix. If there is one already, it shows or hides the app window. This doesn't completely unload the app, it really just hides the window.

+
The default shortcut is kbd:[Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+P].

[[show-hide-custom-playtime]] Helgobox/Playtime: Show/hide custom Playtime::
Works like <<show-hide-playtime>> with the following difference: If there's no Helgobox instance with a Playtime matrix in the current project, it looks for a top-level track template called "Playtime" and adds it to the project. See xref:advanced-usage-scenarios/start-custom-playtime.adoc[].
