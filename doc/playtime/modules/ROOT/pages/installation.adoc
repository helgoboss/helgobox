= Installation

At first, please follow the xref:helgobox::installation.adoc[installation instructions for Helgobox], the add-on that contains Playtime.

== Playtime main toolbar button

After installing Helgobox, the easiest way to access Playtime is by using the convenient image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=50] button in REAPER's main toolbar.

You can add this button very easily by doing this:

. Select menu:Extensions[Helgobox > Show welcome screen]
. Check "Add Playtime button to main toolbar"

== Alternatives

If you don't like that button, here are a few alternatives.

TIP: Manually removing the image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=50] button from the main toolbar is not going to work: You will have it back the next time you start REAPER.
In order to remove the button permanently, open above-mentioned welcome screen and disable the checkbox!

=== Start directly via action

Playtime provides the action xref:reaper-actions.adoc#show-hide-playtime[], which you can invoke from the REAPER action list or via menu:Extensions[Helgobox > Playtime > Show/hide Playtime].
In the action list, you can also assign your preferred keyboard shortcut.
The default is kbd:[Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+P].

=== Add the button to another toolbar

You can add the image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=50] Playtime button to your own toolbar like this:

. Right-click the toolbar and choose menu:Customize toolbar...[]
. Click btn:[Add...] (should open the REAPER action list)
. Search for the action xref:reaper-actions.adoc#show-hide-playtime[] and double-click it.

That's it! you should now see the button in your custom toolbar.
