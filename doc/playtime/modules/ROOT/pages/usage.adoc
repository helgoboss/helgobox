Let's get familiar with the basics!

A typical Playtime usage scenario, from beginning to end, looks like this:

. xref:usage/prepare.adoc[]
. xref:usage/create.adoc[]
. xref:usage/play.adoc[]
. xref:usage/adjust.adoc[]
. xref:usage/structure.adoc[]
. xref:usage/arrangement.adoc[]
. xref:usage/render.adoc[]

In the following sections, we will learn step by step how to do this.

TIP: This guide assumes that you already installed Playtime.
If not, head to the xref:installation.adoc[] page!
