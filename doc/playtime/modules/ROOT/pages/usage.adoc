= Basic usage

Let's get familiar with the basics!

A typical Playtime usage scenario, from beginning to end, looks like this:

. <<prepare>>
. <<record>>
. <<import>>
. <<play>>
. <<adjust>>
. <<structure>>
. <<arrangement>>
. <<render>>

In the following sections, we will learn step by step how to do this.

[[prepare]]
== Prepare

This guide assumes that you already installed Playtime.
If not, head to the xref:installation.adoc[] page!

=== 1. Start REAPER

Playtime runs within REAPER, so at first you need to start REAPER.

=== 2. Set up your audio and MIDI devices

If you haven't done it already, you should let REAPER know which audio and MIDI devices you are planning to use with it, because Playtime will use them as well!

. Open the REAPER preferences via menu:Options[Settings...]
. In the section menu:Audio[Device], configure your audio input and output.
. In the section menu:Audio[MIDI Inputs], configure your MIDI input devices, such as music keyboards.
. In the section menu:Audio[MIDI Outputs], configure your MIDI output devices, such as hardware synthesizers.

If you want to know more about this process, please consult the one and only link:https://www.reaper.fm/userguide.php[REAPER user guide].

=== 3. Fire up Playtime

Press the image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=50] button in the main toolbar, or use any of the alternative ways to start Playtime (described in xref:installation.adoc[]).
After pressing the button, you should see the Playtime window with an empty xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[]:

.Playtime window with empty matrix

At this point, you could directly continue with <<record>>, but I strongly recommend to read the following tip, as it will improve your understanding of how Playtime actually works!

.Understanding what happened when you pressed the Playtime button
====
Pressing the button actually does multiple things in one go!
If you wanted, you could do all of those things also manually.

|Step | Description| How you could do the step manually

|1
|Create a new REAPER track named "Playtime" at the very top of the project
.3+|
* Right-click REAPER's track control panel and choose menu:Insert virtual instrument on new track...[]
* Double-click instrument plug-in "VSTi: Helgobox - ReaLearn & Playtime (Helgoboss)"
* Optionally rename the track to "Playtime"

|2
|Arm the track and set its input to "MIDI: All: All channels"

|3
|Add an xref:helgobox::key-concepts.adoc#instance[instance] of the Helgobox plug-in to the track's FX chain

|4
|Open the xref:helgobox::app.adoc[] associated with that new Helgobox instance
|In the xref:helgobox::plug-in/user-interface.adoc[Helgobox plug-in window], press menu:Menu[Show app]

|5
|Navigate to the Playtime section of the App
|In the xref:helgobox::app/user-interface.adoc[Helgobox app window], press the image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=30] in the xref:helgobox::app/user-interface/navigation-bar.adoc[]

|6
|Create a xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[Playtime Matrix] in this Helgobox instance
|Press the button btn:[Create a Playtime Matrix]
|===

What we learn from that:

* Playtime is built into Helgobox, which is an instrument plug-in, so there needs to be an instance of it somewhere in your project. *→ This is a good thing because it means that you can <<play,play>> it like an instrument!*
* A new Helgobox instance doesn't have a xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[Playtime Matrix] by default.
You first need to create one.
*→ This means Playtime doesn't consume any CPU and memory if you don't use it!*
