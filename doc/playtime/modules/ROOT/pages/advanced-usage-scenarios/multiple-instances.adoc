= Multiple instances

[[feature-multiple-instances]]
Because Helgobox is implemented as an xref:helgobox::plug-in.adoc[instrument plug-in], you can add multiple xref:helgobox::key-concepts.adoc#instance[instances] of it. That also means you can have multiple xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[Playtime matrices] in the same project.

== How to do it

Assuming you have one Playtime instance already, here's how you add another one:

. Right-click REAPER's track control panel and choose menu:Insert virtual instrument on new track...[]
. Double-click instrument plug-in "VSTi: Helgobox - ReaLearn & Playtime (Helgoboss)"
. In the xref:helgobox::plug-in/user-interface.adoc[Helgobox plug-in window], press menu:Menu[Show app]
. In the xref:helgobox::app/user-interface.adoc[Helgobox app window], press the image:screenshots/playtime-toolbar-icon.png[Playtime,width=30] button in the xref:helgobox::app/user-interface/navigation-bar.adoc[] on the left.
. Press the button btn:[Create a Playtime Matrix]

That's it! You now have a second xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[] in the project, that runs independently of the first one.

TIP: Currently, the only way to open that second matrix is to open the xref:helgobox::plug-in/user-interface.adoc[plug-in window] of that second xref:helgobox::key-concepts.adoc#instance[Helgobox instance] and press menu:Menu[Show app]. In the future, a separate REAPER action is planned, to make that step easier.
