= Tempo settings dialog

This dialog opens when right-clicking the xref:user-interface/toolbar.adoc#toolbar-metronome[image:generated/screenshots/elements/toolbar/metronome.png[]] button in the title bar.
It lets you adjust various tempo-related settings.

NOTE: The settings in here are not global!
They are saved as part of the matrix and therefore together with the REAPER project.
