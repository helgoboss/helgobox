// Transport section

Those are different from the REAPER transport controls, as Playtime is capable of playing and recording while REAPER is stopped.

TIP: Right-clicking the smart-record button opens the xref:user-interface/smart-record-menu.adoc[].

If you want to start REAPER playback together with Playtime, you have two options:

[loweralpha]
. Start playback within REAPER itself (which automatically starts Playtime playback)
. Switch xref:user-interface/inspector/matrix/playback.adoc#inspector-matrix-transport-sync[] to **Full**

// Start timing

See xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix-sequence[].

include::partial$generated/elements/toolbar/record-matrix-sequence.adoc[]

This will always create a new sequence.
Old sequences are retained, so you can press this anytime without worrying to overwrite old sequences.

Even though the button turns red right after clicking it, you don't need to rush with your performance.
After recording, Playtime will automatically remove silence at the beginning of the sequence.

If the Playtime column tracks already contain items, pressing this button will show the xref:user-interface/arrangement-writing-mode-dialog.adoc[].

include::partial$generated/elements/toolbar/show-hide-midi-triggers.adoc[]

The purpose of this feature is to quickly create simple mappings of MIDI keys/pads/buttons to cells.
If you want to use full-featured grid controllers, such as the Launchpad, see xref:realearn::user-interface/settings-dialog.adoc#controllers[].

The MIDI triggers configured here are specific to this particular xref:helgobox:ROOT:key-concepts.adoc#instance[], not global.
