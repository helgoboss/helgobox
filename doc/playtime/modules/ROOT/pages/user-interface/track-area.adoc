NOTE: Since multiple columns can have the same playback track, it's possible that you see one track panel multiple times!

The top of the track panel is the _track panel header_.

== Track input section

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/input.adoc[]

WARNING: Playtime captures audio or MIDI input more or less directly from the hardware.
That also means that the track's _input_ FX chain will not have any effect on the recording!
You can work around this limitation by using *Loopback* channels instead of input FX.

TIP: Selecting *Loopback* channels as audio input doesn't automatically enable them!
Make sure that the REAPER setting *Virtual loopback audio hardware channels* in menu:Options[Preferences/Settings... > Audio] is high enough!

NOTE: This directly sets the input of the corresponding REAPER track.
Although technically not necessary for recording because Playtime doesn't use REAPER's track recording facility, it is important for input monitoring.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/midi-channel-filter.adoc[]

NOTE: This directly sets the input MIDI channel of the corresponding REAPER track.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/map-to-midi-channel.adoc[]

NOTE: This directly sets the "Map input to channel" value of the corresponding REAPER track.

NOTE: Which input monitoring mode you choose also has an effect on how Playtime does latency compensation during recording. Read more about that in xref:further-concepts/general.adoc#latency-compensation[].

.Playtime input monitoring explained
====
Playtime input monitoring options are slightly different from REAPER's input monitoring options.
Each input monitoring option mode translates to a certain combination of REAPER track properties:

=== PDC info

If the track is affected by xref:further-concepts/general.adoc#pdc[], a small icon will light up.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/pdc-tiny.adoc[]
include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/pdc-significant.adoc[]
include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/pdc-critical.adoc[]

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/pan.adoc[]

NOTE: This directly sets the pan value of the corresponding REAPER track.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/volume.adoc[]

When not enough vertical space is available, this turns into a drag field, visualizing the peaks as color changes.

NOTE: This directly sets the volume of the corresponding REAPER track.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/instrument-fx.adoc[]

This icon is only visible if there's at least one instrument in the FX chain.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/fx-chain.adoc[]

The button is displayed in bold font if there's at least one FX in the chain.

NOTE: See <<input-monitoring-explained>> to learn how this translates to REAPER track properties.


include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/mute.adoc[]

NOTE: This directly sets the mute state of the corresponding REAPER track.

include::partial$generated/elements/track-panel/solo.adoc[]

NOTE: This directly sets the solo state of the corresponding REAPER track.
