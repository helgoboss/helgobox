[[slot-drag-and-drop]]
.Drag-and-drop support
****
Move slot contents::
Drag this area onto another slot in order to move all clips within this slot to the other slot.

Copy slot contents::
Drag this area onto another slot while holding kbd:[Cmd/Ctrl] in order to copy all clips within this slot to the other slot.

Import content::
Drag a MIDI or audio file from outside onto this area in order to import it as a clip. This should work from the REAPER media explorer, from other plug-ins that offer dragging out content as files and from most file managers.
+
NOTE: Dragging REAPER items onto the slot won't work, because REAPER items are not real files. Use xref:user-interface/slot-menu.adoc#slot-import-selected-item[] instead!
****

include::partial$generated/elements/slot-cell/clip-count.adoc[]

If there's more than one clip in the slot, all will be triggered at the same time.
However, each one will start according to its individual start timing.
