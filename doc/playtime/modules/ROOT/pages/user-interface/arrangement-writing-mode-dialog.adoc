= Arrangement writing mode dialog

This dialog opens when pressing the xref:user-interface/toolbar.adoc#toolbar-write-to-arrangement[image:generated/screenshots/elements/toolbar/write-to-arrangement.png[]] button in the title bar and the current arrangement is dirty. It gives you multiple options how to deal with the fact that there are already items in the arrangement.
