= Key concepts

This section offers brief descriptions of Playtime's key concepts.
An understanding of these concepts is beneficial for effectively using Playtime, regardless of which features you plan to utilize.

== Linear vs. non-linear music production

[[linear-production]]
=== Linear music production

In _linear_ music production, tracks are arranged sequentially along a timeline, supporting structured composition and precise arrangement from start to finish.

[[non-linear-production]]
=== Non-linear music production

In _non-linear_ music production, such as in jamming and sketching, musical elements are arranged in flexible, often loop-based sections that can be triggered or layered in any order, allowing for spontaneous creativity and experimentation.

Playtime's purpose is to add one popular flavor of _non-linear_ music production to REAPER: Music production via <<session-view>>.

[[session-view]]
== Session view / Clip launcher

A _session view_ or _clip launcher_ is a user interface tailored to <<non-linear-production>> where musical elements are arranged in a grid of rows and columns.
Each cell typically holds a single musical element, and users can trigger, loop, and record these elements in real time, often for live performance or experimental composition.

Playtime is a session view.

[[matrix]]
== Matrix

In Playtime, a _matrix_ is the top-level structure.
It is fundamentally a two-dimensional grid of <<slot,slots>> that hold <<clip,clips>>, arranged in <<column,columns>> and <<row,rows>>.
On a broader level, the matrix functions as a container, comparable to a project in REAPER, and includes various settings.

Each xref:helgobox:ROOT:key-concepts.adoc#instance[instance of Helgobox] can load a single Playtime matrix.
By default, it contains no matrix, so it must be created explicitly.
This approach ensures that Helgobox instances dedicated solely to xref:realearn::introduction.adoc[ReaLearn] don't consume any Playtime-related CPU or memory resources - you only "pay for what you use".

[[column]]
== Column

In Playtime, a _column_ refers to a group of <<slot,slots>>, typically arranged vertically.

A column is linked to a <<column-track>>, which is used for playing back the <<clip,clips>> it contains.

TIP: There's one exception: If you load an external matrix preset into Helgobox and an associated column track doesn't exist in the REAPER project, the column will be track-less and unusable for playback.
In this case, you'll need to manually reassign a track in the xref:user-interface/inspector.adoc[].

By default, only one slot in a column plays at a time, but Playtime also allows for simultaneous playback of multiple slots in the same column.

In practice, each column typically represents a single musical instrument or vocal track.

[[column-track]]
== Column track

A _column_ track is a normal REAPER track linked to a Playtime <<column>>.

[[row]]
== Row

Like a <<column>>, a _row_ refers to a group of <<slot,slots>>, but arranged horizontally.

A row is always associated with a <<scene>>, so the terms are often used interchangeably.

In practice, each row often represents a part within a larger song structure.

[[slot]]
== Slot

In Playtime, a _slot_ is a fixed position in the matrix that can hold <<clip,clips>> and can be played back or stopped.
Each slot functions as a mini audio player.

Typically, a slot contains a single clip, but Playtime allows multiple clips in a slot to play back simultaneously.
In such cases, the <<clip-start-timing>> of each individual clip is relevant.
The slot itself does not contain any settings.

[[clip]]
== Clip

In Playtime, a _clip_ is a container that holds a snippet of audio or MIDI, referred to as the <<source>>, and can be configured in various ways.
It is somewhat comparable to an _item_ in REAPER.

In practice, a clip is often a short, beat-aligned loop.

[[source]]
== Source

In Playtime, a _source_ represents the raw media data.

Audio source::
An _audio_ source contains link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio[audio] data.
Technically, it is not more than a reference to an audio file, e.g. a WAV or MP3 file.
All audio formats supported by REAPER are also supported by Playtime.

MIDI source::
A _MIDI_ source contains link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI[MIDI] data.
It is typically used to control instruments.
Technically, it is an in-memory representation of a sequence of MIDI events, similar to REAPER's _in-project MIDI sources_.

[[scene]]
== Scene

In Playtime, a _scene_ denotes a segment within a larger song structure.
It corresponds to a <<row>>.

Each scene features a play button that triggers playback for all <<slot, slots>> in that row.

By default, a scene encompasses all <<slot, slots>> of the row.
However, Playtime allows a <<column>> to opt out of scene playback if desired.

[[matrix-sequence]]
== Matrix sequence

A _matrix sequence_ is a recording of interactions with the <<matrix>>.

Playtime lets you record matrix interactions into a sequence.
Each sequence is saved as part of the matrix.
Later, you can play it back, directly in Playtime.

CAUTION: Matrix sequence playback always uses the current matrix settings, slots and clips for playback.
Therefore,subsequent playbacks don't necessarily sound the same!

Most importantly, a sequence can be "written down" to a REAPER <<arrangement>> at any time: All clips occurrences are placed on <<column-track, column tracks>> as REAPER items.
This is often done at the point in the song creation process, when you are satisfied with the sequence and want to transition to linear arranging on the <<reaper-project-timeline>>.

[[arrangement]]
== Arrangement

In Playtime, an _arrangement_ typically refers to a set of REAPER items on the <<column-track, column tracks>> of the matrix, making it suitable for <<linear-production>>.

An arrangement can be created ...

[loweralpha]
. ... by writing a <<matrix-sequence>> to the arrangement
. ... by exporting clips, scenes or the complete matrix to the arrangement
. ... by placing items there on your own

Playtime is not necessary to play the arrangement back.
You can share a REAPER project containing an arrangement written via Playtime with someone who doesn't own Playtime, and they will still able to play it back!
In practice, however, it's recommended to keep Playtime as part of the project, to freely switch between <<session-view>> and <<arrangement>>.

[[clip-start-timing]]
== Clip start timing

The clip _start timing_ is a configuration property for a <<clip>>.
Because of its importance, it's mentioned here already as a key concept.

The _start timing_ decides when a clip actually starts to be played back, after you have triggered its playback.

We distinguish between _quantized_ start timings and _immediate_ start timing.

Quantized start timing::
By default, the start timing is *1 bar*, which means that the clip will start playing at the beginning of the next bar.
This is what makes everything in-sync. You can change that to arbitrary <<quantization, quantizations>>, such as *2 quarter notes* or *3 bars*.

Immediate start timing::
Alternatively, you can use the start timing *Immediately*, which makes the clip start playing instantly when you trigger it. Of course, that means *you* are now in charge to get the timing right.

You can set the start timing for xref:user-interface/inspector/matrix/playback.adoc#inspector-matrix-start-timing[the complete matrix] and override it on xref:user-interface/inspector/column/playback.adoc#inspector-column-start-timing[column] or xref:user-interface/inspector/clip.adoc#inspector-clip-start-timing[clip] level.

[[clip-stop-timing]]
== Clip stop timing

The clip _stop timing_ is  very similar to the <<clip-start-timing>> but determines when the clip actually stops after you have triggered its stop. In most cases, it makes sense to leave it at its default settings xref:user-interface/inspector/clip.adoc#inspector-clip-stop-timing-like-start-timing[].

== Loop vs. one-shot

[[loop]]
=== Loop

In Playtime, a _loop_ is a <<clip>> that is _looped_, which simply means that it seamlessly repeats after it reached its end.

[[one-shot]]
=== One-shot

In Playtime a _one-shot_ is a <<clip>> that plays only once, that is, it's not looped.

[[bar]]
== Bar

A _bar_, also known as a _measure_, is a section of music that contains a specific number of <<beat,beats>>, as defined by the <<time-signature>>.
It helps organize the music into manageable parts, making it easier for musicians to read and perform.
For example, in a 4/4 time signature, each bar has four beats.

[[beat]]
== Beat

A _beat_ is the basic unit of time in music, serving as the rhythmic foundation for a piece.
Itâ€™s what you tap your foot to when listening to a song.
Beats are grouped together in <<bar,bars>> and can vary in length and speed, creating different feels and tempos in music.

[[time-signature]]
== Time signature

A _time signature_ in music is a way to show how <<beat, beats>> are grouped in a piece.
It tells you how many <<beat,beats>> are in each <<bar>> and which type of note gets one beat.
For example, in a 3/4 time signature, there are three beats per bar, and each beat is a quarter note.
It helps musicians understand the rhythm and feel of the music.

[[time-signature-nominator]]
=== Nominator

The top number of a time signature (the *3* in 3/4) is called _nominator_ and shows the number of beats per measure.

[[time-signature-denominator]]
The bottom number is called (the *4* in 3/4), _denominator_ and shows the type of note that counts as one <<beat>>.

[[in-sync]]
== In sync

In the context of rhythmical music, _in sync_ means that everything is synchronized and the timing aligns correctly. When you play <<loop, loops>> in Playtime, you typically want them to be _in sync_ with each other and with all other rhythmical material on the <<timeline, reference timeline>>.

To achieve this synchronization, the following conditions must be met:

[[in-sync-correct-section]] Correct start and end position::
The start and end positions of the <<clip>> must align *precisely* with a musical <<beat>> in the <<source>>.

[[in-sync-beat-aligned-playback]] Beat-aligned start of playback::
<<clip>> playback must start exactly on a beat of the <<timeline>>.

[[in-sync-playback-with-same-tempo]] Playback with the same tempo::
The <<clip,clips>> must be played back in the same tempo (or a multiple of it).

When using Playtime's default settings, all conditions are automatically met:

* <<in-sync-playback-with-same-tempo>> is met because by default, Playtime starts and stops a clip _recording_ quantized to a 1-bar grid (see xref:clip-start-timing[]).
* <<in-sync-beat-aligned-playback>> is met because by default, Playtime starts and stops clip _playback_ quantized to a 1-bar grid (see xref:clip-start-timing[]).
* <<in-sync-playback-with-same-tempo>> is met because by default, Playtime adjusts the tempo of a clip to the current project tempo (see xref:user-interface/inspector/clip.adoc#inspector-clip-sync-to-project-tempo[]).

[TIP]
====
Concerning the first condition:

* In most cases, you want the start point to align exactly with the downbeat, and the length to be precisely 1 bar (or a multiple of it).
* If the start point is located between beats or the length falls between bars, the loop will be _out of sync_.
* By selecting a <<quantization,quantized>> start/stop timing, such as "1 bar", Playtime ensures that your loop's start point and length are perfectly beat-aligned with sample precision!
* If you choose immediate start/stop timing, it's your responsibility to ensure that the start point and length are musically appropriate.
Achieving perfect timing with a button or foot pedal press is close to impossible.
====

[[quantization]]
== Quantization

A _quantization_ in Playtime defines when an event should occur, such as the start of clip playback or the stop of a recording.
It divides the <<timeline>> into equal time intervals, ensuring that the event occurs only at the beginning of each interval.

A quantization is typically expressed as a <<time-signature>>.

.Quantization examples
====

3/4:: The length of each interval will be 3 quarter notes.
1/8:: The length of each interval will be 1 eight's note.
1/1:: The length of each interval will be 1 bar.
4/1:: The length of each interval will be 4 bars.
====

[[timeline]]
== Timeline

In Playtime, a _timeline_ refers to the concept of time divided into bars and beats, featuring a continuously advancing playhead and a current tempo.

One <<matrix>> has exactly one _reference timeline_ at a given point in time.
<<quantization, Quantized>> events such as start of <<clip>> playback are aligned to this reference timeline.

[[reaper-project-timeline]]
=== REAPER project timeline

When the REAPER project is playing, Playtime uses the _REAPER project timeline_ as reference.
That is, it starts and stop playback according to the bar/beat division and tempo of the REAPER project.

[[playtime-timeline]]
=== Playtime timeline

When the REAPER project is stopped, Playtime uses its own timeline as reference, which however, shares a common tempo with the <<reaper-project-timeline>>.

[[grid-controller]]
== Grid controller

A _grid controller_ is a unique class of hardware controller designed specifically for clip launching. A well-known example is the Novation Launchpad. A grid controller feature a grid of pads with LEDs arranged in rows and columns â€” exactly like Playtime's xref:key-concepts.adoc#matrix[]!

Playtime includes out-of-the-box support for many popular grid controllers. link:https://github.com/helgoboss/helgobox/wiki/Playtime-Controllers[Here] you can find the current list of supported devices.
