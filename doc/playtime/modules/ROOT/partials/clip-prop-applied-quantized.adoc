NOTE: If the clip is currently playing and configured to xref:user-interface/inspector/clip.adoc#inspector-clip-sync-to-project-tempo[synchronize to the project tempo], changes of this clip property will not be applied immediately. Instead, Playtime applies them at the next quantization interval, according to the xref:user-interface/inspector/matrix/playback.adoc#inspector-matrix-start-timing[matrix start timing]. This ensures that the clip will keep playing perfectly in time.
