=== Track input type indicator

This icon indicates whether the track reacts to MIDI or audio input.

This should **not** be confused with a track type! Tracks in REAPER/Playtime don't have any type. A track can always **play** both audio and MIDI clips, no matter what's displayed here. The icon only refers to the current recording input!
