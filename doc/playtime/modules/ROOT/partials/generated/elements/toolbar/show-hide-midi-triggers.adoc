== Show/hide MIDI triggers

Shows or hides MIDI triggers assigned to cells.

The purpose of this feature is to quickly create simple mappings of MIDI keys/pads/buttons to cells. If you want to configure full-featured grid controllers instead (e.g. Launchpad), check out the buttons at the bottom of the navigation bar on the left.

The MIDI triggers configured here are specific to this particular Playtime instance, not global!
