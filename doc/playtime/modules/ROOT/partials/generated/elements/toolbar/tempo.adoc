=== Tempo

Controls the project tempo. This is only possible as long as REAPER playback is stopped and no tempo marker exists in the project.
[NOTE]
.Development status: To be improved
====
The ability to follow the REAPER tempo envelope might come in a future update.

Tempo adjustment during REAPER playback is disabled because of potential timing issues. It might be possible to fix this, but it needs a new feature on REAPER side. **Please note**: Using REAPER's own tempo control during project playback is *not* a workaround! It will potentially cause the mentioned timing issues.
