Pressing this button start or stops Playtime playback.

Stopping playback automatically *ignites* all clips that have been playing. After stopping, you can use the same button to start playback again or use the tap button to count in with a completely new tempo.

Starting playback also triggers playback of all previously *ignited* clips in the matrix. If you want to permanently stop all ignited clips before playback, simply click the matrix stop button.
