This is a convenience button for recording stuff without having to choose a particular matrix slot first.

If nothing is recording yet, it will start recording into the next free slot of the first column whose track is armed.

If there is an ongoing recording, it will be stopped.

If playback is stopped, this button is displayed with a pulse animation. This indicates that pressing this button will trigger a pre-roll recording (if metronome enabled) or that the length of the first recorded clip will dictate the new tempo (if metronome disabled).

Right-clicking the button allows you to change settings related to recording clips.
