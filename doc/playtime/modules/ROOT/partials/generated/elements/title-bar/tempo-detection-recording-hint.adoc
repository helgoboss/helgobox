Playtime is stopped and metronome is disabled.

When you record a clip now, the project tempo will be adjusted to match the length of the recorded clip. This is useful to get started without having to use a metronome.

If you would like to record with count-in instead, enable the metronome.

If you would like to record accompanied by other clips, start playback again before recording clips.
