Playtime is stopped and the metronome is disabled. When you record a clip now, Playtime will initiate a link:https://docs.helgoboss.org/playtime/goto#feature-tempo-detection[tempo detection recording].

If you would like to do a count-in recording instead, enable the metronome.

You can link:https://docs.helgoboss.org/playtime/goto#inspector-matrix-recording-allow-tempo-detection-recording[disable this special behavior] in the matrix recording settings.
