image::generated/screenshots/elements/inspector/matrix/resample-mode.png[Resample mode]

Defines which kind of resampling algorithm to use on audio clips.

Playtime uses resampling in the following cases:

1. Vari-speed time stretching.
2. Adjusting to play rate changes.
3. Adjusting clips that have a sample rate other than the project/hardware sample rate.

This setting applies to all clips in the matrix but it can be overridden at column and clip level.
