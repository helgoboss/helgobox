=== Allow tempo detection recording

image::playtime::generated/screenshots/elements/inspector/matrix/recording-allow-tempo-detection-recording.png[Allow tempo detection recording]

If this is enabled, recording a clip will initiate a link:https://docs.helgoboss.org/playtime/goto#feature-tempo-detection[tempo detection recording] when playback is stopped and the metronome is off.

If disabled, it will initiate a count-in recording instead.
