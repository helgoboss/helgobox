This influences how Playtime detects the tempo of imported or recorded audio material.

Playtime uses tempo detection if you import an audio clip or if you do tempo detection recordings. It derives the tempo from the length of the material, which should always give an accurate result if the material is already cut. However, it can easily happen that Playtime detects half-time or double-time tempos. This might result in clip playback being half or twice as fast as you want. By restricting the tempo detection range, you can improve the results.
