== Follow scenes

image::playtime::generated/screenshots/elements/inspector/column/follow-scenes.png[Follow scenes]

If the column follows scenes, playing a scene (= pressing the play button of the row) will trigger playback of the corresponding slot in this column. This is great for sketching out parts of a song.

If the column doesn't follow scenes, it will ignore scene playback. Good for letting some clips play independently of the song structure.
