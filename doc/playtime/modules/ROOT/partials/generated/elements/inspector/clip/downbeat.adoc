Which beat within the material can be considered the first downbeat.

If you set a beat greater than 0, Playtime will shift the clip to the left accordingly so that the downbeat ends up exactly on the chosen play start timing quantization.

This setting takes effect the next time you trigger this clip with a quantized start timing.
