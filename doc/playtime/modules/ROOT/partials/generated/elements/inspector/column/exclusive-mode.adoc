If exclusive mode is enabled, only one slot at a time in this column will usually be playing. That's good for switching between different variations.

If it's disabled, multiple slots can be playing at the same time. That's great for ad-hoc layering of multiple clips. Please note that the *Trigger mode* is always *Toggle* if exclusive mode is disabled.
