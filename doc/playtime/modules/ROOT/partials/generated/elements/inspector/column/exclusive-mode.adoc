If exclusive mode is enabled, only one slot at a time in this column can be playing. That's good for switching between different variations.

If it's disabled, multiple slots can be playing at the same time. That's great for ad-hoc layering of multiple clips. Please note that the *Trigger mode* is always *Toggle* if exclusive mode is disabled.
