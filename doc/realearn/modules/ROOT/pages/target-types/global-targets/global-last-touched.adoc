[#global-last-touched]
= Global: Last touched

This will control whatever target has been last touched in REAPER.
It's similar to the built-in REAPER action "Adjust last touched FX parameter" but provides the following benefits:

. It's applicable to all ReaLearn targets that are learnable, not just FX parameters.
. It offers feedback.
. It can distinguish between parameter modifications caused by ReaLearn (i.e. hardware control) and those caused in other ways (e.g. via mouse).

== Pick button

This opens a window that lets you pick all considered target types and types of invocations (only macOS and Windows so far).
Last-touched targets not checked in this window will be ignored.
