See the REAPER user guide for details.

Solo in place:: Soloes the track while respecting REAPER's routing.
This is REAPER's default and since ReaLearn v2.4.0 also ReaLearn's default.
Solo (ignore routing):: Soloes the track muting everything else, no matter the routing.
Use REAPER preference:: Follows whatever is set in the REAPER preferences.

Learning this target by pressing the "Solo" button of the _master_ track is currently not possible but of course you can just select it manually in the dropdown menu.
