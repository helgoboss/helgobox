[#osc-send-message]
= OSC: Send message

Sends OSC messages with up to one argument in response to incoming messages.
This target turns ReaLearn into a capable and convenient MIDI → OSC and OSC → OSC converter.
If an argument number is entered (e.g. `1`), it will encode the incoming absolute control value as that argument (after it has been processed by the glue section).

== Output menu

Where to send the OSC message.

<Feedback output>:: Sends the OSC message to the device which is set as _Output_.
Of course this only works if it's an OSC device.
_Specific device:_:: Sends the OSC message to a specific device.
Address, Argument and Range:: These correspond to the identically named settings of xref:source-types/category-osc.adoc[].
Check that section for details.
