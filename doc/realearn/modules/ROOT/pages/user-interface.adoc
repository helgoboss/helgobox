== Helgobox Components

Helgobox consists of two main components, each with its own user interface:

Helgobox Instrument Plug-In::
This interface appears when you open the plug-in window and represents the core of ReaLearn's user interface.
Most of the information in this section focuses on the instrument plug-in.

Helgobox App::
This interface is accessible via menu:Menu[Show app] in the plug-in.
In the future, the app will also be available for mobile devices and offer remote connections to REAPER.
Currently, the app only provides the interface for Playtime with the following exceptions:
+
* ReaLearn's xref:further-concepts/unit.adoc#projection[] feature
* ReaLearn's global controller settings
