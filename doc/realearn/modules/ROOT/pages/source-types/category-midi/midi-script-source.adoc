[#midi-script-source]
= MIDI Script source

This source is feedback-only and exists for enabling more complex feedback use cases such as controlling LCDs that are not yet supported by the xref:source-types/category-midi/display.adoc#display-source[] source.
It lets you write an EEL or Luau script that will be executed whenever ReaLearn "feels" like it needs to send some feedback to the MIDI device.

== Kind menu

Whether to use the EEL or Luau language.

== Script field

The script.
Is disabled if the script contains more than one line.

See xref:further-concepts/source-concepts.adoc#midi-source-script[] for details.

== More button (â€¦)

Opens the script in a separate window (for multi-line scripts).

TIP: Prefer the xref:source-types/category-midi/display.adoc#display-source[] source over this one whenever possible.
It's easier to use.
