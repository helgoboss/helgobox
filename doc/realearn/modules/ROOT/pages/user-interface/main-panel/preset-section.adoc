== Preset menu

This menu makes it possible to load compartment presets for the currently shown compartment.
If you select a preset in this list, its corresponding mappings will be loaded and immediately get active.

The following menu entries are available:

[[none-preset]] <None>::
This entry is selected by default.
It means that no particular preset is active.
+
Selecting this will always clear the complete compartment, including all mappings!

Factory:: Contains available xref:further-concepts/compartment-concepts.adoc#factory-compartment-preset[factory presets].

User (...):: Contains available xref:further-concepts/compartment-concepts.adoc#user-compartment-preset[user presets].
Multiple of such submenus may exist.
Each one represents a different preset namespace/workspace.
The namespace named after you (macOS/Linux/Windows username) is your personal user namespace.
+
For more information about preset workspaces/namespaces, see
xref:further-concepts/compartment-concepts.adoc#writing-presets-with-luau[].

User (Unsorted)::
This submenu contains top-level presets which are not part of a particular preset namespace/workspace.
This was common in older versions of ReaLearn, when namespaces/workspaces were not yet available.

== Save button

If you made changes to a user preset, you can save them by pressing this button.

== Save asâ€¦ button

This allows you to save all currently visible mappings as a new preset.
Please choose a descriptive name.

== Delete button

== Auto-load button

Activates or deactivates xref:further-concepts/unit-concepts.adoc#auto-load[] mode for this ReaLearn unit.
This button is only available for the xref:key-concepts.adoc#main-compartment[] because auto-load is only about loading xref:further-concepts/compartment-concepts.adoc#main-preset[main presets].

Off:: Disables auto-load mode (the default).

[[auto-load-based-on-unit-fx,Auto-load based on unit FX]] Based on unit FX::
