= Mapping row

image:realearn/screenshots/main-panel-mapping-row.png[Screenshot]

Each mapping row represents one ReaLearn mapping.

The mapping, source and target labels of a mapping row are greyed out whenever the mapping is _off_.
See xref:key-concepts.adoc#mapping[].

== Mapping-enabled checkbox

This checkbox at the top left of the mapping row enables or disables the mapping as a whole.

== Activity indicator (●)

This indicator at the very left of the mapping row lights up on incoming control messages whenever they match the mapping source.

Attention: This doesn't necessarily mean that the message will reach the target, although it often does.
There are certain settings in the xref:user-interface/mapping-panel/glue-section.adoc[] section which allow you to filter messages even they matched the source (e.g. xref:user-interface/mapping-panel/glue-section.adoc#source-min-max[]).

== Up/down buttons

Use these buttons to move this mapping up or down the list.

== Control/feedback-enabled checkboxes (→/←)

Use these checkboxes to enable/disable control and/or feedback for this mapping.
Disabling both has the same effect as disabling the mapping as a whole.

[[row-edit-button]]
== Edit button

Opens the mapping panel for this mapping.

== Duplicate button

Creates a new mapping just like this one right below.

== Remove button

Removes this mapping from the list.

[[learn-source-button]]
== Learn source button

Starts or stops learning the source of this mapping.
See xref:key-concepts.adoc#learn-source[].

[[learn-target-button]]
== Learn target button

Starts or stops learning the target of this mapping.

Learning a target that is currently being automated is not possible at the moment because ReaLearn can't know if the value change notification is coming from the automation or your touch interaction.

== Right-click menu

Each mapping row provides a right-click menu for accessing the following functions:

Copy:: Copies this mapping to the clipboard.
Paste (replace):: Replaces this mapping with the mapping in the clipboard.
If the clipboard contains just a part of a mapping (source, mode or target), then just this part gets replaced.
Paste (insert below):: Creates a new mapping that's like the mapping in the clipboard and places it below this mapping.
Copy part:: Copies just a part of the mapping (activation condition, source, mode or target).
Move to group:: Lets you move this mapping to another mapping group.
Advanced:: Provides access to expert features.
Copy as Lua::: Copies this mapping as Lua/Luau code.
This is an indispensable tool if you want to build your mappings in Luau because it gives you a readily executable code snippet that you can adjust as desired.
Copy as Lua (include default values)::: Includes even default values.
Paste from Lua (replaces)::: Like _Paste (replace)_ but treats the clipboard content as Luau code.
Paste from Lua (insert below)::: Like _Paste (insert below)_ but treats the clipboard content as Luau code.
Log debug info (now)::: Logs debug information about this particular mapping.
