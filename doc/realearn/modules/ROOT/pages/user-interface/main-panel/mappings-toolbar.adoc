[[add-one]]
== Add one button

Adds a new mapping at the end of the current mapping list.

[[learn-many]]
== Learn many button

Allows you to add and learn many new mappings in a convenient batch mode.
Click this button and follow the on-screen instructions.
Click _Stop_ when you are finished with your bulk learning strike.

[#search]
== Search field

Enter text here in order to display just mappings whose name matches the text.

You can search for mappings that have a certain tag by entering the tag name prefixed with the hash character `#`.
For example, you can search for all mappings tagged with the tag `mixing` by entering `#mixing`.

The search expression also supports wildcards `\*` and `?` for doing blurry searches. `*` stands for zero or more arbitrary characters and `?` stands for one arbitrary character.

[[filter-source]]
== Filter source button

When you press this button, ReaLearn will start listening to incoming MIDI/OSC events and temporarily disable all target control.
You can play around freely on your controller without having to worry about messing up target parameters.
Whenever ReaLearn detects a valid source, it will filter the mapping list by showing only mappings which have that source.

This is a great way to find out what a specific knob/fader/button etc. is mapped to.
Please note that the list can end up empty (if no mapping has that source).

As soon as you press btn:[Stop], the current filter setting will get locked.
This in turn is useful for temporarily focusing on mappings with a particular source.

When you are done, and you want to see all mappings again, press the btn:[X]
button to the right, which clears the filter.

TIP: Before you freak out thinking that ReaLearn doesn't work anymore because it won't let you control targets, have a quick look at this button.
ReaLearn might still be in "filter source" mode.
Then just calm down and press btn:[Stop].
It's easy to forget.

[[filter-target]]
== Filter target button

If you want to find out what mappings exist for a particular target, press this button and touch something in REAPER.

As soon as you have touched a valid target, the list will show all mappings with that target.

Unlike <<filter-source>>, ReaLearn will automatically stop learning as soon as a target was touched.

Press the btn:[X] button to clear the filter and show all mappings again.

The mapping rows area consists of multiple mapping rows.
One for each mapping.
