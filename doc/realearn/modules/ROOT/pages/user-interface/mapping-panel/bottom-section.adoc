= Bottom section

image:realearn/screenshots/mapping-panel-bottom.png[Screenshot]

The section at the bottom has the following functions:

- To provide context-sensitive help for the glue section
- To provide control information, feedback information and error reporting
- To provide navigation and general mapping control

== Help

Context-sensitive help for the glue section.
Whenever you touch a setting in the glue section, some text will appear which explains what this element does, both for the _control_ and for the
_feedback_ direction (if applicable).

== Activity info area

The left text area shows information about how an incoming control value was handled and possible target control errors.

NOTE: If the target supports MIDI real-time control and the source is a MIDI source, this currently only works if "Log target control" is enabled (see xref:user-interface/main-panel/menu-bar.adoc#logging-menu[]).

The right text area shows information about which feedback values are sent from the glue section to the source.

[#beep-on-success]
== Beep on success checkbox

Makes the mapping play a sound whenever the target has been invoked successfully.
Nice for trigger-like targets such as xref:target-types/realearn-targets/realearn-take-mapping-snapshot.adoc#realearn-take-mapping-snapshot[] for which there's no other good way to know if it worked.

[#previous-next-mapping]
== Previous/next buttons

Allows you to jump to the previous or next mapping.
Considers only mappings that are currently visible in the mapping rows panel.

[#enabled]
== Enabled checkbox

Enables or disables the mapping as a whole.
