= Target "Marker/region: Go to"

Navigates to a specific marker or region.
Here's the behavior in detail:

Regions::
* If the project is stopped, the editor cursor immediately jumps to the start position of the given region.
* If the project is playing, playback will continue with the given region as soon as the currently playing region (or measure if not within a region) has finished playing.
This is called "smooth seek".
* *Attention:* This currently doesn't work if the project containing ReaLearn is not the active project tab.

Markers::
* If the project is stopped, the editor cursor immediately jumps to the given marker.
* If the project is playing, playback will immediately be continued at the given marker.

The advantage over REAPER's built-in actions is that this target allows to target arbitrarily many markers/regions (either by position or by ID) â€¦ and that it supports visual feedback!
If you assign this target to a button which has an LED, you will see which marker/region is currently playing just by looking at your controller.

Please note that this doesn't work when recording!
