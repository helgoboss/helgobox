= Target "Track: Arm/disarm"

Arms the track for recording if the incoming absolute control value is greater than 0%, otherwise disarms the track.
This disables "Automatic record-arm when track selected".
If you don't want that, use xref:targets/track-targets/track-selectunselect.adoc#track-selectunselect[] instead.
