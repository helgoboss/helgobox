= Target "FX: Load snapshot"

Restores a certain state of a particular FX.
Before using this target, you need to take a snapshot of the desired FX state using the btn:[Take!] button.
This snapshot will be saved as part of ReaLearn's state itself and as a direct consequence as a part of your project.
This makes your project nicely self-contained.
It's perfect for activating particular FX presets because it will always restore the desired state, even if the preset list has changed.

This target supports feedback, but only if the snapshot is loaded via ReaLearn itself.

Please note that some plug-ins have _very large_ states.
Therefore, you should keep an eye on the snapshot size, which will be displayed once you take the snapshot.
ReaLearn's own state will grow with every new snapshot mapping, so this can quickly add up and make REAPER/ReaLearn slow!
