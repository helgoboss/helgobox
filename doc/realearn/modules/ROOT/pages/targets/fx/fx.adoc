[#fx-target]
= Target "FX"

A target that allows you to define an FX, in its basic variant perfect for acquiring feedback for a specific FX.

== Act/Tags controls

The setting **Act/Tags** allows you to optionally set/pin the declared FX as xref:further-concepts/unit-concepts.adoc#unit-fx[].
This works pretty much the same as described in target xref:targets/track/track.adoc[].
