= Target "ReaLearn: Dummy"

This target simply does nothing when invoked and also doesn't provide any meaningful feedback on its own.

It's sometimes useful to have such a dummy target, e.g. combined with xref:user-interface/mapping-panel/glue-section.adoc#group-interaction[].
Or if you want to use ReaLearn as a MIDI filter which just "eats" an incoming MIDI message.
Or if you want to send some text feedback to a hardware display, if the text is just a constant string or uses a placeholder that doesn't need target context.
