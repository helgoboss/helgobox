= Target "FX parameter: Set automation touch state"

This is similar to xref:targets/track/set-automation-touch-state.adoc[] but for FX parameter value changes.

IMPORTANT: There's one difference.
This target currently only reacts to _release_ events, not _press_ events.
So you can't start writing automation by touching the fader.
You can only end writing automation by releasing it.
The reason is that REAPER doesn't provide a function `TrackFX_BeginParamEdit`, it only provides link:https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascripthelp.html#TrackFX_EndParamEdit[TrackFX_EndParamEdit].
