= Target "FX parameter: Set value"

Sets the value of a particular track FX parameter.

== Parameter controls

Use them to set the parameter to be controlled.

Please note that both xref:further-concepts/target.adoc#particular-fx-selector[] and xref:further-concepts/target.adoc#at-position-selector[] address the FX by its position in the FX chain.
The difference between the two is that xref:further-concepts/target.adoc#particular-selector[] shows a dropdown containing the available parameters and xref:further-concepts/target.adoc#at-position-selector[] lets you enter the position as a number in a text field.
The latter is useful if at the time of choosing the position, the FX is not available.

== Retrigger checkbox

By default, ReaLearn doesn't set the parameter if it already has the desired value. That prevents unnecessary invocations.

However, some FX parameters are more like triggers. They don't actually have a value and are just used to trigger some action within that FX. In this case, it's important to enable _Retrigger_, which sets the parameter no matter what.

== Real-time checkbox

=== Main thread vs. real-time thread

By default, ReaLearn does FX parameter value adjustments from the so-called _main_ thread instead of the _real-time_ thread. That means, in the worst case, we get latency as long as one main loop cycle. One main loop cycle is usually around 30Â ms.

In many control scenarios, this is completely acceptable. Basically, all control surface solutions including REAPER's built-in control surfaces, CSI and DrivenByMoss adjust FX parameters in the _main_ thread. Imagine you adjust a volume with a knob for mixing purposes. Such adjustments are usually rather slow and gradual, so it won't matter if the effect comes in 5 ms or 30 ms later.

However, ReaLearn is a tool not just for mixing, also for performing. And in performing, there's sometimes demand for low latencies and fast responses, even when controlling FX parameters.

=== Enabling real-time

If you enable this checkbox, ReaLearn will **under certain conditions** control the FX parameter from a _real-time_ thread, enabling much lower latencies. In particular, the latency will correspond to the configured audio device block size -- the same thing that influences how fast virtual instruments respond when you press a note.

The conditions are as follows:

Condition 1: Same track:: The controlled FX must be on the **same track** as the ReaLearn instance.

Condition 2: FX input:: The xref:key-concepts.adoc#input-port[] must be set to xref:user-interface/main-panel/input-output-section.adoc#fx-input[], **not** to a particular device.

In all other circumstances, ReaLearn will fall back to adjusting the FX parameter from the _main_ thread.
