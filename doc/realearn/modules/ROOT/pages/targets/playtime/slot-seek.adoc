= Target "Playtime: Slot seek"

This target exists mainly to provide xref:key-concepts.adoc#feedback[] about the current playback position of the xref:playtime::key-concepts.adoc#slot[].

For example, you can use it to make an LED ring, motor fader or text display indicate the current playback position.

[CAUTION]
====
This also works in xref:key-concepts.adoc#control[control direction], changing the current play position of the clips in that slot. But this is **experimental**.
