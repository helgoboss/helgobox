= Target "Project: Seek"

Allows you to use faders, knobs, encoders or incremental buttons to seek within portions of your project â€¦ with feedback that indicates the current position!

== Feedback menu

Determines how frequently ReaLearn captures feedback and sends it to your feedback output.

Beat:: Roughly every beat.

Fast:: As fast as possible, thereby giving the satisfying feeling of continuity.

== Behavior menu

Determines whether to use immediate or smooth seeking.

== Seek play checkbox

Doesn't just change the edit cursor but also changes the play position when the project is currently being played.

== Move view checkbox

Allow to scroll / change viewport when seeking.

== "Use" checkboxes

The following checkboxes determine which time ranges will be taken into consideration as reference for seeking (control) and feedback.

If you don't tick any "Use" checkbox, ReaLearn will seek within the currently visible viewport.

If you tick multiple options, this is the order of fallbacks:

* If there's no time selection, the loop points will be used.
* If there are no loop points, the current region is used.
* If there's no current region, the project will be used.
* If the project is empty, the viewport will be used.

=== Use time selection checkbox

Can use the currently set time selection as reference.

=== Use loop points checkbox

Can use the currently set loop points as reference.

=== Use regions checkbox

Can use the current region as reference.

=== Use project checkbox

Can use the complete project as reference, from start to end.
