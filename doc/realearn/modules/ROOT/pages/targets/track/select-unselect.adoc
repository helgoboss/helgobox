= Target "Track: Select/unselect"

Selects the track if the incoming absolute control value is greater than 0%, otherwise unselects the track.

This target stops being learnable if you activate the REAPER preference "Mouse click on volume/pan faders and track buttons changes track selection" (because this preference would generate too many false positives).
If you change the preference, ReaLearn will take it into consideration the next time you restart REAPER.
