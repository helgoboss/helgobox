= Source "Speech"

This source works for xref:key-concepts.adoc#feedback[] only.
It uses the native Windows or macOS text-to-speech engine to speak out any feedback value.

== Troubleshooting

If you don't hear anything, check the xref:user-interface/main-panel/bottom-section.adoc[] if unit-wide feedback is currently off.
If yes, maybe xref:user-interface/main-panel/menu-bar.adoc#send-feedback-only-if-track-armed[] is enabled but your track is not armed.

Also keep in mind that ReaLearn only resends feedback when it changed. Therefore, the speech source will only say something when the target value actually changes.
