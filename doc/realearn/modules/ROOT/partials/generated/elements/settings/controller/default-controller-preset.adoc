In general, ReaLearn will figure out the correct controller preset based on the main preset's needs and the connected controller.

**Only set this if you came up with your own controller preset and want to use that instead of the auto-detected one!** Even then, ReaLearn might choose a different controller preset if your one doesn't provide at least one of the virtual control schemes required by the main preset.
