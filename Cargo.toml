# I absolutely need Flutter to be able to connect with ReaLearn based on a LAN IP address. Without this hack, Flutter
# will fail to connect with a TLSV1_ALERT_DECODE_ERROR. As soon as https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/54 is
# closed and rustls has updated the dependency, we should remove this!

# Yes! Thanks to the use of axum-server (instead of warp) we don't need this Hyper patch anymore! axum-server seems to
# use lower-level Hyper features and implements a proper graceful shutdown feature on it that allows one to specify a
# timeout. If not all connections are closed until that timeout, it just shuts down forcibly. That's important and
# exactly what we need. We need the server shutdown happen immediately before ReaLearn is unloaded without having to
# force the user to wait for open connections to finish. The following was a temporary hack to make this possible.
# See https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1885, https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2386.
# For a moment, I thought that I need to reintroduce this patch for gRPC, which is driven by tonic. Indeed, when using
# tonic's serve_with_shutdown() feature, REAPER doesn't quit until Playtime gRPC client has disconnected :/ But
# fortunately, using the tokio::select! workaround (mentioned in issue 2386) works and *also* closes the ports this
# time! Turns out the same is actually true for axum, so we use select! there as well.
