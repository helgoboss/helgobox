    // egui-baseview requires the state to be Send but we want to support state that is not Send,
    // that's why we use Fragile, which checks that we access the state from the main thread only.
    //
    // It's slightly inconvenient to require Send because the Advanced Script Editor has state that
    // contains `ScriptEditorInput` which uses a Box<dyn ScriptEngine>. We would have to make this
    // Send and this would either require some restructuring (viable but too lazy now) or make mlua
    // use the "send" feature, which would have a big effect on the Lua integration (that would be
    // possible but would make everything harder for no win, because we currently don't want to use Lua in
    // any other thread than the main thread anyway).
    // Fortunately, at least on macOS and Windows, the Send requirement of egui-baseview seems to be
    // not really necessary since the state is only being used from the main thread anyway.
    // It think with baseview for X11, it's a different story. It seems to be running on its own thread
    // there. But we don't have egui enabled on Linux anyway - exactly for that reason. Because that
    // it's not the main thread there also causes other issues. I was hoping to one day write an egui
    // integration for X11 that just uses the main thread.
